# Vengeance_DamageCalc

A damage calculator for SMTV: Vengeance.
We've learned a lot of info about how damage is calculated, and I really hate doing needless repeated absurd amounts of math, so I decided to take hold of my competitive Pokemon roots and make a damage calculator.
The interface is meant to be a simple UI once it's up and running, but I won't pretend like I'm making this to be shipped out and popular.   It's just a pet project.
If I want to make it more accessible in the future, I will make a web-based version instead.
